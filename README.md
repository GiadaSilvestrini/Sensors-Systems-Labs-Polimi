Here you can find all the lecture projects (named "Sensors Systems #"), homeworks (named "homework #") and exercises (mostly exam projects that I know that have been asked, they are named "Ex#") executed for the 2023-2024 Edition of the Sensor Systems course at Politecnico di Milano held by professor Federica Villa.

Furthermore, in the folder "Lab documents" you can find additional material: the most useful is the "project descriptions and useful info" excel file, in which I mapped each project/homework/exercise to its description, and each sensor present on our board to its pins (I also wrote what to look for in the schematics to find them).
Such file can be used during the exam to quickly detect the project to modify, and the pin to enable to connect a required sensor.
